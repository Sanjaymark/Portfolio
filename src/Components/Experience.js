                "   During my tenure at HCL Technologies from November 2020 to November 2022, I served as an Analyst, where I honed my skills in 
                    IT operations and management. My primary responsibilities involved working with cutting-edge tools like SolarWinds and 
                    ServiceNow to ensure the seamless functioning of critical IT systems. <br></br> I developed a deep understanding of 
                    network monitoring and performance optimization through SolarWinds, while ServiceNow allowed me <br></br> to gain proficiency in 
                     incident management and ticketing systems."
